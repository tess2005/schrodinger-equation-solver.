Numerical solution of 1D Schrödinger equation using Python.
1D Schrödinger Equation Solver – Infinite Square Well
Project Description:
This project numerically solves the 1D time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a particle in an infinite square well using Python. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, including energy eigenvalues, wavefunctions, and normalization. The solution uses the finite difference method (FDM) to discretize the Hamiltonian and solve the eigenvalue problem.
Key Features:
Calculates the first several energy eigenvalues and corresponding wavefunctions.
Plots normalized wavefunctions superimposed with energy levels.
Fully self-contained Python script (.py) or interactive notebook (.ipynb).
Modular and extendable for other potentials such as finite square well or harmonic oscillator.

Usage:

Educational Value:
Introduces numerical methods in quantum mechanics.
Visualizes wavefunctions and quantized energy levels.
Serves as a foundation for more advanced quantum simulation projects.
